      - title: Table Cell Sizes
        text: >-
          A table will fit the width of its container, in some cases you may
          want to limit the max width of a table. 


          Adjusting the padding around the table cells changes the tables appearance. 


          • None: Not used oftern - Only if you need in nest extra content inside a table cell. 


          • Small: Used to create a more compact table. 


          • Medium: The go-to table cell size for the majority of applications. 


          • Large: Used when there is plenty of space and a small data set.

    title: Usage Guidelines
    blocks:
      - title: Right align numeric values
        text: >-
          When working with numeric values generally they should be
          right-aligned to provide ease of scanning and comparing. Column
          headers follow the alignment of the data. 


          Numbers that do not need comparing, such as phone numbers, can be left aligned.

        text: When there are gaps in the data, use a dash (-) to represent null or not
          applicable values.
