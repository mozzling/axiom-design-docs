          Badges show counts using numerical figures only, with the exception of
          mathematical symbols such as “+” , ”-“ and ”%” and number
          abbreviations such as “k” and “m”. For more guidance see \[number
          formats]


          \[Lozenges] highlight an item's attributes or status and can use alphanumeric characters.
